# Pytorch Implementation of popular machine learning models
This repo is a collection of popular machine learning models.
Will continuously add the codes...


### Dependencies

* All codes have been tested on  Python 3.6. with pytorch 0.4+. 


### Models

1. Multi-layer perceptron on MNIST (test accuracy: 93%)

```bash
python mlp_mnist.py
```

2. CNN on MNIST (test accuracy: 98.5%)

```bash
python cnn_mnist.py
```

3. ResNet18 on MNIST (test accuracy: 99%)

```bash
python resnet_mnist.py
```
